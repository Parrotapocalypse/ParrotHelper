# ParrotHelper
Maybe this will convince people that they should upload their mods to GitHub.

In terms of content, this mod has the following:
## Entities
* <b>Custom Fake Heart</b>: A fake heart that can have a custom color. Unlike most hearts, this one plays the fake heart cutscene from Farewell when collected, with custom dialog and poem name as usual.
* <b>FlagBerry</b>: A strawberry that sets a flag when collected, with normal strawberry features otherwise.
## Other info
* To download the mod itself, go to its [Gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/320381).
* Ping or DM Parrotapocalypse#3122 on Discord if you have bug reports or suggestions of changes or more things to include.

* More stuff will be added in The Future<sup>TM</sup>
